# Super-Hang-On

This is a tribute to the classic Arcade and Sega Genesis/Megadrive title Super Hang-On, the game of fast-paced motorbike racing extravaganza! <br />
<br />
Super Hang-On is the sequel to the acclaimed Hang-On, from Arcade and Master System fame. It was released in 1987 for the arcades, and in 1989 for the Sega Genesis. <br />
The game, while not as popular as other similar titles like OutRun, is still considered a classic and has received a number of re-editions and ports, often being included in classic game collections. Due to this it has seen play in many different platforms, as well as being able to be downloaded in different services like Playstation Network, XBox Live Arcade or the Nintendo eShop. 

## What this tribute is

The tribute contains a demo of what could be a fully playable stage in Super Hang-On. It contains sprites and music straight from the game, but the sound effects are not the same.<br />
Since the project is just for demonstration purposes, the stage is actually shorter than a real Super Hang-On course. Even though the game tells you the avaliable track (Europe) has 18 sections, in reality it only has 6. Each section is also much shorter than those in the real game.<br />
Besides this, the game is fully playable and keeps track of the score records, as well as each individual segment time.<br />

## Game objective

The objective of the game is simple: Get to the end of the race before you run out of time. There are several check-points along the way that will increment the amount of time you have, but you'll also have to evade the rival racers as well!<br />
Some of the turns are way too tight to be taken at full velocity, but if you manage to maximize your speed you'll be able to activate your booster in order to drive even faster than before! This might be a life saver if you messed up and crashed somewhere along the way.
